# Pok-mon---MC322-project
This repository contains the implementation of a simple pokemon game. As it was developed for the OOP discipline, we used the concepts learned in the discipline to develop it. The project was developed in a group, the other members being: Adriano Campos (AdrianoCampos05), Pedro da Silva (pedro-git-hub) and Matheus Scatolin (Matheus-F-Scatolin).
